### Hi there 👋
<p> 
As a software engineer with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Information Technology, I am passionate about using technology to solve complex problems and improve people's lives. Throughout my academic and professional experiences, I have developed a strong foundation in programming concepts, software development methodologies, and best practices for building high-quality, scalable applications.

One area where I have particularly excelled is in using Angular, a popular front-end web development framework. Since 2020, I have been working extensively with Angular to develop dynamic, responsive user interfaces that deliver a seamless user experience. I am highly skilled in using Angular to build complex applications, and I enjoy keeping up to date with the latest trends and updates in the framework.

In addition to my technical skills, I am a strong communicator and collaborator, with a proven track record of working effectively in cross-functional teams. I am always eager to learn from others and share my knowledge and expertise to help create innovative solutions that exceed expectations.

Overall, I am a dedicated, detail-oriented software engineer with a passion for using technology to create meaningful, impactful solutions. I am excited to continue developing my skills and contributing to the success of innovative projects in the field of software engineering.
